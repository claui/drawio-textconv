# drawio-textconv

## What is this?

This command-line tool gives you meaningful diffs for `.drawio.svg`
and `.drawio` [diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagrams.net)
that you have checked into Git.

It plugs into Gitâ€™s
[textconv](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_performing_text_diffs_of_binary_files)
facility.

## Why do I need this?

This tool will give you meaningful diff output if you regularly
check draw.io diagrams into Git, especially diagrams with source
embedded into SVG (`.drawio.svg`).

If you have no idea what this means, then this tool is probably not
going to be useful to you.
